# Rusty Pong

This game was created as my introduction to Rust and Bevy. There is nothing overly exciting contained within aside from, possibly, how I've chosen to organize the source, which will not be very interesting to those with any level of experience.

## My setup

* Windows 10 Pro N
* Rust 1.76.0-nightly
* VS Code 1.85.1
    * with Rust Extension Pack
